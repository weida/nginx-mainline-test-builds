# Build New Nginx with Latest Dependencies

This repository builds the latest **mainline** nginx and freenginx packages with current **PCRE2**, **zlib**, **OpenSSL**, **liboqs**, and **HTTP/3** support.

It is primarily a **test / tracking / early-adoption** build project. The Docker images and GitHub releases follow upstream mainline quickly and should not be treated as a long-term stable distribution channel.

## Intended Use

- Track upstream mainline nginx and freenginx quickly
- Test new HTTP/3 / TLS / OpenSSL combinations
- Validate compatibility on modern and older glibc targets

## Not a Stable Distribution

- Mainline versions can change behavior between releases
- Older GitHub releases are intentionally pruned
- Docker tags may move when `latest` or `latest-compat` is rebuilt
- Production users should pin explicit version tags instead of relying on `latest`

---

## Features

- ✅ **HTTP/2** support
- ✅ **HTTP/3 (QUIC)** support
- ✅ **TLS 1.3** with modern cipher suites
- ✅ **OpenSSL 4.0** support
- ✅ **Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)** support when using OpenSSL 4.0+ / ECH-capable builds
- ✅ **Post-Quantum Cryptography** (ML-KEM, ML-DSA via OpenSSL 4.0+)
- ✅ Automatically fetches the latest mainline versions from GitHub for:
  - PCRE2
  - zlib
  - OpenSSL
  - liboqs (Open Quantum Safe)
  - Nginx
- ✅ Multi-architecture Docker images (x86_64, ARM64)
- ✅ Standard and compatibility image tracks
- ✅ Automated CI/CD builds and releases

## Image Tracks

This project publishes two runtime tracks for both nginx and freenginx:

| Track | Tags | Runtime | Builder | Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard | `latest`, `<version>` | Scratch/minimal runtime with libraries copied from updated Ubuntu 24.04 builder | Ubuntu 24.04 | Modern distributions with recent glibc |
| Compat | `latest-compat`, `<version>-compat` | AlmaLinux 8 minimal | CentOS 7 + devtoolset-9 | Older glibc targets, including CentOS 7 era systems |

The standard runtime is not a general-purpose Ubuntu shell image. It is built
from `scratch` and contains nginx, required shared libraries, CA certificates,
and passwd/group data only. Package managers and archive utilities such as
`apt`, `dpkg`, `tar`, and `sed` are not present in the final image.

The compat track is still built against a CentOS 7 / glibc 2.17 environment for
runtime compatibility, but it uses `devtoolset-9` so OpenSSL 4.0 and current
nginx sources can be compiled with a modern enough GCC.

### Build Performance Notes

The compat track remains aimed at CentOS 7 / glibc 2.17 compatibility (with
`devtoolset-9` for a modern enough GCC). EOL CentOS 7 yum/SCL repos are pointed
at `http://archive.kernel.org/centos-vault` (including `altarch` for aarch64) so
arm64 builds under QEMU are not blocked by `vault.centos.org` HTTPS 403s.

Compat is expected to build slower than the standard track:

- It compiles nginx, OpenSSL, PCRE2, and zlib from source.
- Compat and standard both build `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (arm64 under
  Docker buildx/QEMU in GitHub Actions where needed).
- Final OpenSSL 4.0 validation took about 39 minutes for nginx compat and about
  43 minutes for freenginx compat.

This is build-time cost only. It does not mean the resulting runtime image is
expected to be slower for normal nginx serving workloads.

## Release Retention Policy

- GitHub Releases keep only the most recent mainline builds for each track
- Docker Hub keeps the runnable image tags used for testing and version pinning
- If you need reproducibility, pin an explicit Docker tag such as `1.29.8` or `1.29.8-compat`

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

For testing only. For repeatable environments, replace `latest` with a concrete version tag.

**nginx - Standard version** (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, RHEL 9+):
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -p 443:443/udp \
  caoweida2004/nginx-http3:latest
```

**nginx - Compatible version** (CentOS 7, Alibaba Cloud Linux 3, Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11):
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -p 443:443/udp \
  caoweida2004/nginx-http3:latest-compat
```

**freenginx - Standard version** (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, RHEL 9+):
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -p 443:443/udp \
  caoweida2004/freenginx-http3:latest
```

**freenginx - Compatible version** (CentOS 7, Alibaba Cloud Linux 3, Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11):
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -p 443:443/udp \
  caoweida2004/freenginx-http3:latest-compat
```

See [README-Docker.md](README-Docker.md) for detailed Docker usage.

### Option 2: Build from Source

**Build nginx**:
```bash
bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weida/nginx-mainline-test-builds/refs/heads/main/nginx-builder.sh)
```

**Build freenginx**:
```bash
NGINX_OWNER=freenginx NGINX_REPO=nginx bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weida/nginx-mainline-test-builds/refs/heads/main/nginx-builder.sh)
```

## Supported Operating Systems

This script has been successfully tested on the following systems:

- **Ubuntu**: 24.04.1 LTS
- **CentOS**: CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009
- **Alibaba Cloud Linux**: Alibaba Cloud Linux release 3 (Soaring Falcon)

---

## Prerequisites

The script automatically detects your package manager (`yum` for CentOS or `apt` for Ubuntu) and installs the required packages. Minimal build tools include:

- **gcc**
- **make**
- **wget**
- **tar**
- **libtool**

For CentOS, **perl-IPC-Cmd** is also required. These dependencies will be installed automatically by the script.

---

## Usage

### Install and Build Nginx

Run the following command to download and execute the script, building the latest version of Nginx:

```bash
bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weida/nginx-mainline-test-builds/refs/heads/main/nginx-builder.sh)
```

### Output Example

After the script completes, you’ll see the Nginx version and linked library details:

```plaintext
=== Checking Nginx version ===
nginx version: nginx/1.27.3
built by gcc 10.2.1 20200825 (Alibaba 10.2.1-3.8 2.32) (GCC)
built with OpenSSL 4.0.0
TLS SNI support enabled
configure arguments: --prefix=/usr/local/nginx --user=nginx --group=nginx ...
```

```plaintext
=== Done. Nginx installed to /usr/local/nginx ===
    PCRE2:   10.44
    zlib:    1.3.1
    OpenSSL: 4.0.0
    Nginx:   1.31.0
```

---

## Configuration Details

### Libraries and Versions

The script detects and uses the latest tags for:

- **PCRE2**: Latest version (e.g., `10.44`)
- **zlib**: Latest version (e.g., `1.3.1`)
- **OpenSSL**: Latest version, currently OpenSSL 4.0 by default
- **Nginx**: Latest mainline `release-*` tag

### Static Compilation

All libraries are statically linked with Nginx, ensuring a self-contained binary.

### TLS 1.3 Support

OpenSSL is compiled with `enable-tls1_3` and a reduced build scope for nginx usage:
`no-tests no-docs no-apps`.

---

## Nginx Build Options

The script configures Nginx with the following default options:

```bash
--with-http_ssl_module \
--with-http_v2_module \
--with-http_gzip_static_module \
--with-http_stub_status_module \
--with-http_realip_module \
--with-http_sub_module \
--with-pcre=/path/to/pcre2 \
--with-zlib=/path/to/zlib \
--with-openssl=/path/to/openssl \
--with-openssl-opt="enable-tls1_3 no-tests no-docs no-apps ..." \
--with-cc-opt="-O2" \
--with-ld-opt="-Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib"
```

### Customization

You can modify these options in the script to add or remove features according to your requirements. Refer to the [official Nginx documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/) for a full list of available configuration options.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography Support

This build includes OpenSSL 4.0+ with built-in support for NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms:

- **ML-KEM** (FIPS 203) - Quantum-resistant key exchange
- **ML-DSA** (FIPS 204) - Quantum-resistant digital signatures
- **Hybrid modes** - Combine traditional and post-quantum algorithms

See [docs/POST-QUANTUM-CRYPTO.md](docs/POST-QUANTUM-CRYPTO.md) for configuration guide.

**Quick example**:
```nginx
ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
ssl_ecdh_curve X25519MLKEM768:X25519:prime256v1;
```

## Encrypted Client Hello Example

The repository includes a runnable shared-mode ECH example under
[`examples/ech`](examples/ech). It generates an ECH PEM file with
`openssl ech`, starts the Docker image with `ssl_ech_file`, then verifies the
connection with `openssl s_client -ech_config_list` and NGINX access-log
evidence.

```bash
cd examples/ech
OPENSSL_BIN=/path/to/openssl-4 ./test-ech.sh
```

The ECH test requires Docker Compose and an OpenSSL 4.0+ CLI that includes the
`ech` command.

---

## Notes

1. The script automatically installs dependencies using the detected package manager (`yum` or `apt`).
2. Ensure sufficient disk space and administrative privileges before running the script.
3. If your distribution is not listed under **Supported Operating Systems**, you may need to make manual adjustments.
4. Docker images and GitHub Releases in this repository are for mainline testing and validation, not long-term stable support.
